# tachyons-animate
Single purpose classes to help you orchestrate CSS animations

I made this project to help me get more out of my animations. It's inspired by tachyons and intended to be an extension of the toolkit. There are NO animation keyframes, only single purpose classes that control:
- animation-play-state : `.pause`
- animation-iteration-count : `.infinite`, `.double`, `.triple`
- animation-direction: `.reverse`, `.alternate`, `.alternate-reverse`
- animation-duration & animation-delay each have a 6 point scale and some absolute values

**More documentation on the way!**
